-- Task 4 baseline: "Tenant Match Health" report, as it exists in production today.
--
-- Parameters are inlined for readability; the service binds :date_from / :date_to.
-- The report powers an internal dashboard that is loaded on every page view by
-- the ops team, one tenant at a time, plus a nightly all-tenant roll-up.
--
-- Contract you must preserve: same columns, same rows, same values.
-- Ordering is defined by the ORDER BY at the bottom.
